Doctrine Guides extension
=========================

This extension provides the necessary features to build the Doctrine
documentation.

It is intended for use for building the documentation as part of
``doctrine/doctrine-website``, but also in CI actions of each Doctrine
project, so that contributors can validate and preview their changes.
